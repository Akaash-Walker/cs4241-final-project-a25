# Group 16 Final Project Proposal

Our project idea is to make a website that a user can connect their Spotify to. From there, users would see a heatmap of the world based off of their most recently listed to artists. They would be able to zoom in and see what artists are from a specific area of the world.

For technologies, we plan to use React, Express, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, and HTML.
